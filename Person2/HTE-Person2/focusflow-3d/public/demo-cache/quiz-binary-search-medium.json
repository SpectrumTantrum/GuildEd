      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Binary search halves the search space each step, resulting in O(log n) time complexity."

      "correct_index": 0,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Binary search requires the data to be sorted so it can eliminate half the remaining elements at each step."

      "question": "In binary search, if the target is less than the middle element, where do you search next?",

      "correct_index": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Since the array is sorted, if the target is less than the middle, it must be in the left (lower) half."
